      <h1>Simultaneous Brightness Theory in UI Design</h1>
      <p>
        The simultaneous brightness illusion is an optical illusion in which the perceived brightness of an area is affected by the brightness of surrounding areas. Specifically, when an area of lower brightness is surrounded by an area of higher brightness, the lower brightness area appears even darker than it actually is, while an area of higher brightness surrounded by an area of lower brightness appears even brighter than it actually is.

This illusion occurs because of the way our visual system processes information about brightness and contrast. The neurons in our visual system respond not only to the absolute brightness of a stimulus, but also to the relative brightness of surrounding stimuli. When we look at an area of low brightness surrounded by higher brightness, the neurons in our visual system responsible for processing the low brightness area are inhibited by the neurons processing the surrounding higher brightness, which makes the low brightness area appear even darker.
        Simultaneous brightness theory plays a significant role in UI design as
        it influences the perception of colors and brightness. When two colors
        are placed side by side, their perceived brightness can change,
        affecting the overall visual appeal and readability of the interface. In
        UI design, it's essential to consider this phenomenon when selecting
        color schemes, backgrounds, and text colors to ensure a harmonious and
        visually pleasing user experience. By understanding simultaneous
        brightness theory, designers can create more effective and aesthetically
        appealing interfaces that cater to users' visual perception. The circle
        below seems to change colour even though the colour has not changed
